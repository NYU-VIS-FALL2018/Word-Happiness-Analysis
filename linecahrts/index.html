    <p>Trends in World Giving Index rank for USA </p>
    <svg id="generous"></svg>
    <p>The United States has slipped down the rankings to fifth place, 
            its lowest ranking since 2011. A five percentage point decrease in the USAâ€™s overall score is driven by 
            lower levels of donating money (down seven percentage points to 56%) 
            and volunteering time (down five percentage points to 41%).

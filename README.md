## About
For the second consecutive year in 2018, the United States has taken a notch
down in the World Happiness Report’s annual ranking of more than 150 countries, published by
the Sustainable Development Solutions Network, an initiative of the United Nations. It is a
general belief that a country with a booming economy and high income should have a high
happiness rank. But that’s not the case with the USA. Over the last 3 years, we have seen a
decline in its happiness rank irrespective of a continued increase in GDP. In this project we aim to analyze the factors which are causing 
the USA's happiness index irrespective of a steeadily thriving economy.

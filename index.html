<h1>America's Declining Happiness - A social or an economic crisis?</h1>

<div class="innerbox">
	<h2>What is Happiness Score?</h2>
  <p style="width: 500px;">
  Happiness Index Score measures the sustainable well-being for a country. It is an indication which tells us how well a nation is doing at achieving long, happy, sustainable lives. It is important to measure the happiness index scorebecause it is a better measure of a nation’s progress than individual measures like GDP, Life
Expectancy etc. Happiness Index Score is calculated taking factors like GDP per Capita, Family happiness, Life Expectancy, Freedom, Generosity, Trust etc. Taking these factors into consideration,
we are analyzing how the happiness index score of USA increases or decreases due to the above factors.

  <p><i>For the second consecutive year in 2018, the United States has taken a notch down in the World Happiness Report’s annual ranking of more than 150 countries, published by the Sustainable Development Solutions Network.
It is a general belief that a country with a booming economy and high income should have a high happiness rank.

<p>We can see in the graphs above that the happiness score for the USA has continuously dropped. Even though the happiness score has taken a dip, over the last 3 years, the GDP has been increasing. Over the last half-century, the GDP of the US has more than tripled. But the same is not true for Cameroon, whose happiness and GDP are increasing hand in hand.

        <p style="font-size:15px; color:#fffff; font-weight:bold; text-align:justify;"> 1. Increase in substance abuse in America is a clear indicator of the collective mental state of Americans. Surveys have shown that American workers are struggling with high levels of stress anxiety and depression and thus lower happiness.</p>

    </div>

    <p>
      This can be explained by the abundance of family warmth and other supportive social relationships in Latin America. Having someone to count on has a big impact on happiness, and the quality of the community is key to feeling safe. 2017 was a challenging year for Americans’ well-being. The national Well-Being Index score for the U.S. in 2017 was 61.5 – a decline from 62.1 in 2016.

The United States has slipped down the rankings to fifth place, its lowest ranking since 2011. A five percentage point decrease in the USA’s overall score is driven by lower levels of donating money (down seven percentage points to 56%) and volunteering time (down five percentage points to 41%).</p>

  Happier countries tend to be more generous and think about extending advantages to future generations and other countries. And engaging in some sort of charity and donations makes one feel grateful and is one of the key elements for feeling satisfied and happy.

        There is huge income inequality in the USA as seen in the graph below.
    </div>
  </div>
    <p>
      As the incomes of the 1% pull away from those of the rest, people’s overall life satisfaction becomes lower and their day-to-day negative emotional experiences are greater in number. This can be explained by a simple reason that even if you are a member of the relatively well-to-do middle class, some things start getting priced beyond your reach, such as private schools and houses in the best neighborhoods.

  4. Trends in Corruption Perception Index

          Nearly six in ten people now say that the level of corruption has risen in the past twelve months, up from around a third who said the same in January 2015.

      </div>
    </div>
    <p>
      Corruption is measured by The Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) published annually by Transparency International since 1995 which ranks countries "on a scale from 100 (very clean) to 0 (highly corrupt)". Corrupt nations tend to have low levels of happiness and life satisfaction. More and more people are losing their trust int he government bodies due to corruption which in turn making them unhappy.

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

  Conclusion
  <br>

  </p>
        <p>
          As seen from the graphs above, to make America happier again, we need to come up with policies that target social factors like curbing corruption, effective drug control, improving social support system and bridging the huge income gap between the riches and the poor. Simply focusing on increasing the wealth and economy won’t help, it’s the proper distribution of the wealth that can make Americans believe that the government is working for them rather than just for the rich.
